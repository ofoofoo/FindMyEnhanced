# MIT Heat Map
Track your day-to-day location patterns at MIT with the [MIT Heat Map](INSERT_URL_HERE)!

Made by Abhay Bestrapalli, Orion Foo, Nathan Xiong, and Ram Goel.

## How it works
As you walk around MIT's campus, login to [MIT Heat Map](INSERT_URL_HERE) and click on your location on the map. Whenever you go to another building, click the new location on the map. We track the time spent at each location and use it to display a heat map of where you spend most of your time on campus. 

## Features
Our website has three main features for visualizing location data:
* User Heat Map - displays a heat map for the user's location data. See where you spend most of your time!
* Combined Heat Map - displays a heat map for all users' location data combined. See where everyone is spending most of their time!
* Path Markers - displays a set of markers for where the user has been in that day, and draws a path indicating the user's path for that day. See where you've been today!
